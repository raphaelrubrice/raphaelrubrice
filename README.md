# Raphaël Rubrice

Hi ! I'm Raphaël Rubrice, 
I'm deeply interested in the potential of AI in Biology and Health aswell as in Bioinformatics. I've always been drawn to the intersection of computational methods with biological questions and challenges. 

Currently following a Master 2 in Artificial Intelligence and Computational Biology at [Paris-Saclay University](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/) and [AgroParisTech Engineering School](https://www.agroparistech.fr/en), my thirst for new knowledge and skills is stronger than ever ! I am constantly trying to improve my data science and programming skills which make me eager to contribute to impactful and ground-breaking projects involving AI and/or Bioinformatics.

Operating Systems I've worked with:
